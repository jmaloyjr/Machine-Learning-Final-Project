# Machine-Learning-Final-Project
Using a dataset on for detection of parkinsons patients we plan on running a multitude of ML algorithms and classification methods to determine which algorithm most successfully classifies those who show signs of early onset parkinsons.

Running test.py can help make sure you have all the packages installed, and will inform you of their versions

How to run code:  
    python main.py
